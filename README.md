# Bubble Sort Visualizer

## Overview

This is a simple C++ program for visualizing the Bubble Sort algorithm using graphics. The program sorts a randomly shuffled array of integers and displays the sorting process graphically using the BGI (Borland Graphics Interface) library.

## Features

- Visualizes the Bubble Sort algorithm in action.
- Generates a random array of integers to be sorted.
- Displays the sorting process graphically in real-time.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later.
- BGI (Borland Graphics Interface) library for graphics support.
- Unix-like system for usleep function (for delay).
